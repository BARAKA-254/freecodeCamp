                        Cyber Security awareness
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We live in a digital era where most attacks happen digitally. 
                        In this era, data is one of the most important assets that we posses. 
                        This leads to a need for data protection.
                        <br>
                        This is why we organize events such as this in order to equip people with tricks used by 
                        cyber criminals to help them secure themselves against such attacks.

                        Software Hackathon
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe there a several software solutions built in the dark that lack enough exposure to 
                        blow up but would blow up if given enough exposure.
                        <br>
                        That is why we decided to host such an event,
                        to give exposure to all the startup ideas in the presence of 
                        VCs who might want to fund any idea they might find interesting.

                        Competitive Programming

                    <p>
                        This was a fun experience for young developers to come together and have fun while 
                        learning from each other. 
                        <br>
                        Competitive programming has proven to sharpen skills and help young devs  
                        develop their critical thinking and problem solving skills under pressure.
                        <br>
                        We would love to host more such events in future.

                        This was an event hosted to train young cyber security enthusiasts on penetration testing and 
                        ethical hacking.
                        <br>
                        With increase in cyber attacks, demand fro cyber security experts has hit an all time high.
